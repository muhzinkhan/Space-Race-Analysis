- All the data was **collected** using this scraping script using Selenium: [space_mission_scraper.py](space_mission_scraper.py)

- Made **predictions** on the space mission success rates: [Predictions.ipynb](Predictions.ipynb)

- **Served** the model on a web server using Streamlit: [streamlit_app.py](streamlit_app.py)
